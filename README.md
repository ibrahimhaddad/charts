# Charts
This repo contains individual open source charts &amp; infographics available for anyone to use / re-use as they wish while respecting the [license](LICENSE.md). 

I create these charts for fun and to share this knowledge. Usually one chart is enough content for a whole 30-60 mins presentation. If you're organization is interested to host me to speak on any of these topic, please [reach out](https://www.ibrahimatlinux.com/contact.html).
